Python ML
---------
Python 3 machine and deep learning algo scripts using Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Xgboost,
Keras, Theano, TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Virtual Environment
-------------------
1. python3.12 -m venv env
2. source env/bin/activate
3. pip3 list | pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
